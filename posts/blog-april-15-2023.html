                    &emsp;Hello Friends! I am presenting you with an intriguing article I found entitled “Evolving approaches to educating children from nomadic communities” by Carolina Dyer. She provides three case studies from four countries which includes: Kenya, India, Afghanistan, and Indonesian. I should note that the article was published in 2016 and, therefore, the information related to Afghan children may not reflect the current situation post-Taliban takeover. Nonetheless, I will focus on the issues which arise in educating the sea nomads of Indonesia. These sea nomads are “primarily subsistence fishers and traders of primary produce who ply their trades along the region&rsquo;s extensive coastlines and islands” (Dyer, 47). I would go as far as to say that they are the maritime cousins of land-locked hunter-gatherers.

                    &emsp;Furthermore, it is considered a tradition for sea nomads to live on their boats. The indigenous education that children receive includes learning to navigate their boats, swim, and fish. They also gain valuable knowledge of navigation, mapping, and other tricks-of-the-trade. Dyer states that, “Indonesia comprises an archipelago of 18,307 islands, some 6,000 inhabited, and a population estimated in 2013 at 242.3 million (WPS 2013) distributed across 300 ethnic groupings with diverse languages, religions, and social customs” (Dyer, 48). She then goes on to describe the Malay Orang Laut sea people of Southeast Asia. She writes, “The area they have occupied for centuries falls within what is now the Singapore-Indonesia Malaysia Growth Triangle. Disregard of Orang Laut&rsquo;s territorial and resource rights, which affects access to resources and seasonal routes, is accompanied by water pollution and deforestation of foraging grounds (Chou 2006). Estimates of their population vary considerably—from 3,000 to 12,000—and their participation rates in formal education are low. Chou (2010) reports that most have no more than one year of schooling and that state education programmes typically fail to ensure their inclusion. That there is uptake of schooling anyway reflects falling prosperity and settlement in coastal areas, which draws the Orang Laut into competition with local residents for depleting marine resources” (Dyer, 48).
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;Although these sea nomads may seem far-removed from the concrete jungles of modernity, it is crucial that they receive formal education alongside their indigenous education. This is because formal education will help them to “integrate into market economies, defend rights to resources, tackle political marginalization, and challenge policies that encourage sedentarization” (Dyer, 40). To further this goal there have been calls for Education for All (EFA) to remove the disparities in the education of nomads. Efforts by the EFA have been mainly focused on increasing the delivery methods of education along with targeting student mobility as a barrier to access. This focus on access is related to accessibility in Tomaševski&rsquo;s 4A framework which falls under the Right to Education and seeks to eliminate obstacles to the education of children (Tomaševski, 12). Despite these efforts, the Orang Laut still have a difficult time making use of the educational services offered. This is because of unpredictable fishing hours, inability to afford school costs, bullying from non-nomads, and low relevance of education to their livelihood. Moreover, Dyer states that, “Sea nomads have low policy visibility, and their fit within education policy narratives is questionable. The 2003 EFA Action Plan does not specifically mention them” (Dyer, 48). This fact is saddening and highlights how it is pertinent that nomadic groups, especially hunter-gatherers, receive attention regarding access to education.
