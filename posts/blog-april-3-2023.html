                    &emsp;Hello Friends! The article “Perpetuating the Myth of the &lsquo;Wild Bushman&rsquo;: Inclusive Multicultural Education for the Omaheke Ju|&rsquo;hoansi in Namibia, written by Velina Ninkova, discusses the “challenges of multicultural education for severely marginalized groups and questions its applicability in a highly segregated society” (Ninkova, 159). In 1990, the Republic of Namibia won its independence from South Africa and the education system was democratized with the inclusion of historically oppressed groups, the indigenous San people for example, as a goal. These people were previously nomadic hunter-gatherers before they lost access to traditional lands, livelihoods, and resources. Ninkova writes, “Prior to independence, due to geographic dispersion and stigmatizing views against the San, the colonial administration put little effort into providing access to schooling for San children. After independence, the San gained improved access to education, with state efforts including the adoption of a progressive education policy that recognizes the value of cultural and linguistic diversity. Yet, despite a comprehensive educational reform, and research that has repeatedly identified the barriers to education for San children, their participation in the education system remains limited and unsatisfactory” (Ninkova, 159-160).

                    &emsp;The author, Ninkova, carried out ethnographic research beginning in 2008 among the Ju|&rsquo;hoan groups of Southern Africa. Her findings point towards several structural barriers that block the Ju|&rsquo;hoansi from becoming fully invested in the educational system. These barriers fall into three categories: socioeconomic barriers, stigma or bullying barriers, and linguistic or cultural barriers. She states that, “To collect focused data on educators&rsquo; interpretations of the education policy and the challenges they faced to its implementation, I undertook a month-long ethnographic fieldwork in the Omaheke in November 2018. I visited eight primary schools in and north of the administrative town of Gobabis, where the Ju|&rsquo;hoan population of the region resides. I carried out semistructured interviews in English with seven school principals and 12 teachers. The interviewed educators self-identified as Herero, Owambo, Tswana, Damara, Afrikaner, and Coloured. The respondents were made aware of the scope of my research, and I received oral consent from each. I also carried out a total of 7 hours of classroom observations in three schools” (Ninkova, 167). The seven principles were aware of Namibia&rsquo;s educational policies regarding the San and other marginalized communities. Six principles remarked that there were not enough Ju|&rsquo;hoan teachers present on the market to “facilitate the visibility” of the culture. Out of the twelve teachers surveyed, ten said that they did not have sufficient guidance from school management in how to handle the Ju|&rsquo;hoan learners.

                    &emsp;Regarding socioeconomic barriers, the San people lack the funds pay for school supplies, uniforms, and fees despite Namibia&rsquo;s free education policy. Ninkova states, “Since most San communities are located in remote areas, hostel and transport fees add to the cost. San children unanimously cite lack of uniforms, shoes, and supplies as major reasons for dropping out” (Ninkova, 164). Such underlying costs for a supposedly free education are common across the world and especially affect these marginalized groups. Additionally, she writes that, “One of the most common tropes accompanying Ju|&rsquo;hoan learners in the Omaheke is that they are &lsquo;difficult&rsquo; to work with. The principal of one school said that they were &lsquo;lucky&rsquo; to only have a limited number of &lsquo;difficult&rsquo; (meaning Ju|&rsquo;hoan) learners in the school. In the words of one school secretary: &lsquo;We try to give them what and what, but the San learner is a San learner. We can&rsquo;t change this. They are bush people. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m telling you that the San learner is the most difficult learner on Earth&rsquo;” (Ninkova, 169). This is a clear example of how deep rooted stigma surrounding a historically oppressed and marginalized group can further the educational, and resultingly economic, divide. Another stigma is that the Ju|&rsquo;hoan learners are exceptionally lazy, stubborn, and uncooperative. She writes, “One teacher explained this in the following manner: &lsquo;The San are smart people because they are bush people. You cannot survive in the bush if you are stupid. Their brains work fast and they learn quickly. But they are also very lazy, and this is where all the problems come from&rsquo;” (Ninkova, 171). Alongside stigma or bullying, linguistic and cultural differences block education of the San peoples under Namibia&rsquo;s policy. Ninkova states, “When asked whether certain aspects from Ju|&rsquo;hoan culture could be incorporated in the curriculum and be relevant or valuable for all learners, teachers could not come up with specific ideas. One teacher acknowledged that the San possessed a lot of knowledge about &lsquo;survival in the bush&rsquo; but that this knowledge was not compatible with &lsquo;modern education influenced by Western values.&rsquo; Teachers cited two major barriers to inclusion of more culturally specific material in schools, namely, lack of knowledge and heterogeneity of classes” (Ninkova, 174). As previously stated, these structural barriers (socioeconomic, stigma, and cultural or linguistic) continue to block the Education for All initiative in Southern Africa.

                <p class="card-text">
                    &emsp;The problem of inclusive multicultural education for the Omaheke Ju|&rsquo;hoansi is closely related to accessibility which falls under the Right to Education in Tomaševski&rsquo;s 4A framework. Tomaševski writes that accessibility includes: “elimination of legal and administrative barriers, elimination of financial obstacles, identification and elimination of discriminatory denials of access, and elimination of obstacles to compulsory schooling (fees, distance, schedule)” (Tomaševski, 12). These structural barriers to education are not limited to the San peoples of Southern Africa but are common among nomadic hunter-gatherer groups such as the Sea Nomads of Indonesia and many others. It is crucial that these barriers be targeted by the Education for All initiative such that inclusive and diverse educational systems can be created in host countries of these marginalized communities. Likewise, I think that Ninkova, with her article, provides an excellent example of how research into barriers to access can be researched.
