## Learning Plan:
- Create various projects using different languages, technology, etc.
- Have extensive documentation on my progression for each project
- For projects built using tutorials:
  1) Document what I learned from tutorial
  2) Create a clone of the project
  3) Improve and Customize that project
  4) Write documentation on my improvements
