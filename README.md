## Learning Plan:
- Create various projects using different languages, technology, etc.
- Have extensive documentation on my progression for each project
- For projects built using tutorials:
  1) Complete the project (give credit to authors)
  3) Document what I learned from the tutorial
  4) Create a clone of the project
  5) Improve and customize that project
  6) Document my improvements
- For projects that I build from scratch:
  1) Complete the project
  2) Document my work
  3) Add updates (fixes, improvements, etc.)
  4) Document the updates
- Each weekend I will start a new project

## Learning Goal:
- To have a myraid of projects built
- Learn novel and applicable skills
- Apply those skills to a career in Software Development
